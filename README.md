# Hello World! 👋🏽
My name is Kadhirash Sivakumar and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of California, Riverside and am pursuing a network programming degree from De Anza. I love working on projects and applications where I can see it have a positive impact in people. I am a former Software Engineer Intern at Trelliss, a startup company focused on bettering one's mental health.
