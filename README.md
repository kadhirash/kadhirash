# Hello World! 👋🏽
My name is Kadhirash Sivakumar and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of California, Riverside and am thinking of pursuing a network programming degree from De Anza. I love working on projects and applications where I can see it have a positive impact in people. I am a former Software Engineer Intern at Trelliss, a startup company focused on bettering one's mental health. I am also a content moderator/reviewer for [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books), one of the TOP ten starred repos out of tens of millions on GitHub!
